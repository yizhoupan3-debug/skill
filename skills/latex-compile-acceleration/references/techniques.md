# LaTeX compile acceleration techniques

This note keeps the **source-backed technique matrix** outside `SKILL.md` so the
skill stays cheap to route.

## Practical ranking

For most repos, the best default stack is:

1. `latexmk` baseline
2. partial compile (`\includeonly`, `subfiles`, `standalone`) when structure allows
3. TikZ / PGFPlots externalization for figure-heavy projects
4. preamble precompilation (`mylatexformat`) for package-heavy documents
5. draft mode during iterative writing
6. TeXpresso for live preview workflows
7. Tectonic + cache for CI / reproducible environments

That ranking is an **inference from the upstream sources below** rather than a
single upstream tool claiming universal superiority.

## Technique matrix

| Need / bottleneck | Recommended move | Why it helps | Caveats | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard local build is too slow or repetitive | `latexmk` | Tracks dependencies and reruns only as needed; supports preview-continuous mode (`-pvc`) | Still not true AST-level incremental compilation | [CTAN latexmk](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk), [latexmk manual PDF](https://tug.ctan.org/support/latexmk/latexmk.pdf), [latexmk man page](https://www.mankier.com/1/latexmk) |
| Need watch-based rebuilds | `latexmk -pvc` | Rebuilds on file changes without manual rerun loops | Still reruns TeX when watched sources change | [latexmk man page](https://www.mankier.com/1/latexmk) |
| Need near-live rendering while editing | TeXpresso | Designed for live rendering and immediate error feedback | Early-phase project; editor integration matters | [TeXpresso repo](https://github.com/let-def/texpresso) |
| Heavy TikZ figures dominate build time | TikZ externalization | Reuses generated figure PDFs instead of re-typesetting every figure | Cache invalidation after macro / preamble changes needs discipline | [PGF/TikZ external library](https://tikz.dev/library-external) |
| Heavy PGFPlots dominate build time | PGFPlots externalization | Later runs include exported graphics, reducing typesetting time considerably | Similar invalidation caveats | [PGFPlots externalization docs](https://tikz.dev/pgfplots/libs-external) |
| Large multi-file book / thesis, only one chapter is changing | `\includeonly` | Compile only selected `\include` files while preserving reference scaffolding | Requires `\include`; omitted chapters are not rendered | [LaTeX reference: splitting input](https://latexref.xyz/Splitting-the-input.html), [LaTeX reference: `\\include` / `\\includeonly`](https://latexref.xyz/_005cinclude-_0026-_005cincludeonly.html) |
| Need chapter / subdocument isolation | `subfiles` | Lets subfiles compile separately or under the main document | Requires project structure buy-in | [CTAN subfiles](https://ctan.org/pkg/subfiles), [subfiles repo](https://github.com/gsalzer/subfiles) |
| Need fast figure / snippet isolation | `standalone` | Great for figure-heavy workflows and separately compiled subdocuments | Most helpful when the repo already treats figures as separate units | [CTAN standalone](https://ctan.org/pkg/standalone), [standalone repo](https://github.com/MartinScharrer/standalone) |
| Want cleaner wrapper behavior and temp-output handling | ClutTeX / `latexrun` | Cleaner output handling, rerun management, and convenient wrappers | Wrapper ergonomics, not guaranteed raw-engine speedup | [ClutTeX repo](https://github.com/minoki/cluttex), [latexrun repo](https://github.com/aclements/latexrun) |
| CI cold starts / reproducibility pain | Tectonic + cache | Self-contained engine with local bundle caching; Actions ecosystem supports caching | Not always a drop-in replacement for every TeX Live workflow | [Tectonic repo](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic), [Tectonic first document guide](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/book/latest/getting-started/first-document.html), [setup-tectonic action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-tectonic) |
| Need a task-graph around LaTeX dependencies | `pytask-latex` | Explicit dependency graph on top of LaTeX projects | Extra Python tooling and still typically shells out to `latexmk` | [pytask-latex repo](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-latex) |
| Need document-directed build rules | `arara` | Encodes build recipes in-document, reducing command drift | More orchestration than raw compile-speed improvement | [arara repo](https://github.com/islandoftex/arara) |
| Package-heavy preamble loads slowly | **Preamble precompilation** (`mylatexformat`) | Dumps preamble state to `.fmt` format file; subsequent runs skip package loading entirely — up to 2× speedup | `.fmt` must be regenerated after preamble changes; some packages incompatible; LuaLaTeX + OpenType fonts may not dump cleanly | [CTAN mylatexformat](https://ctan.org/pkg/mylatexformat), [TeX.SE: precompile preamble](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/39058) |
| Writing / iterating, images not needed yet | **Draft mode** (`\documentclass[draft]{...}`) | Skips image rendering, marks overfull boxes; ideal for content-first editing | Images show as empty boxes; some packages change behavior in draft | common best practice |
| Intermediate TeX passes generate unneeded PDF | **`-draftmode` flag** for intermediate passes | Tells the engine to skip PDF output and only update aux files; final pass generates real PDF | latexmk does not auto-detect; needs custom `$pdflatex` recipe | [latexmk man page](https://www.mankier.com/1/latexmk) |
| PDF compression costs CPU during compile | **Reduce PDF compression** | `\pdfcompresslevel=0` + `\pdfobjcompresslevel=0` — removes zlib overhead at the cost of larger PDFs | Development only; re-enable for final output | [TeX.SE](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/51849) |
| Images compiled slowly due to format conversion | **Image format optimization** | Pre-convert figures to PDF (vector) or JPEG (raster); pdfLaTeX handles PDF/JPEG/PNG natively but converts EPS on the fly | Requires upstream tooling (Inkscape, ImageMagick) | [Overleaf graphics guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Inserting_Images) |
| Multi-file project needs parallel chapter builds | **`make -jN` parallel** | Makefile defines per-chapter latexmk rules; `make -j4` compiles chapters concurrently | Only useful for independently compilable chapters; merge step needed | [TeX.SE](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/8791) |

## Good default commands

### `latexmk` baseline

Use one of these as the first optimization pass:

```bash
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error -file-line-error -synctex=1 -outdir=build main.tex
```

```bash
latexmk -xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error -file-line-error -synctex=1 -outdir=build main.tex
```

Watch mode:

```bash
latexmk -xelatex -pvc -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error -file-line-error -synctex=1 -outdir=build main.tex
```

### Tectonic

Batch compile:

```bash
tectonic -X compile main.tex
```

Watch mode:

```bash
tectonic -X watch main.tex
```

### Preamble precompilation (`mylatexformat`)

Generate the `.fmt` format file (one-time, re-run only when preamble changes):

```bash
# For pdflatex
pdftex -ini -jobname="mypreamble" "&pdflatex" mylatexformat.ltx main.tex

# For xelatex
xetex -ini -jobname="mypreamble" "&xelatex" mylatexformat.ltx main.tex
```

Then add `%&mypreamble` as the **very first line** of `main.tex` to use the
precompiled preamble. Alternatively, use `\endofdump` in the preamble to define
which portion is "static" (precompiled) vs "dynamic" (re-processed every run).

### Draft-mode compilation

During writing, enable draft mode to skip image rendering:

```latex
\documentclass[draft]{article}
```

Or pass via command line without editing the `.tex` file:

```bash
latexmk -pdf -pdflatex="pdflatex %O '\PassOptionsToClass{draft}{article}\input{%S}'" main.tex
```

### PDF compression bypass (development only)

Add early in preamble for faster dev builds, remove for final output:

```latex
\pdfcompresslevel=0
\pdfobjcompresslevel=0
```

## `.latexmkrc` best practices

A well-configured `.latexmkrc` in the project root improves both speed and
tidiness. Example:

```perl
# Engine selection
$pdflatex = 'pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error -file-line-error -synctex=1 %O %S';
# $pdf_mode = 5;  # uncomment for xelatex
# $pdf_mode = 4;  # uncomment for lualatex

# Separate output and aux directories
$out_dir  = 'build';
$aux_dir  = 'build/aux';

# Extra extensions to clean with `latexmk -c`
$clean_ext = 'synctex.gz run.xml bbl nav snm vrb';

# Biber for bibliography (if using biblatex)
$bibtex_use = 2;

# Preview-continuous settings
$preview_continuous_mode = 1;
$pdf_previewer = 'open -a Preview %S';  # macOS; adjust for Linux
```

## Selection heuristics

Use these heuristics unless the repo already has a strong house style:

- **Paper / report / thesis, ordinary workflow** → `latexmk`
- **Figure-heavy scientific manuscript** → `latexmk` + externalization
- **Large thesis / book** → `latexmk` + `\includeonly` or `subfiles`
- **Live-preview-centric editing** → TeXpresso
- **CI / reproducible automation** → Tectonic + cache
- **Wrapper ergonomics / clean temp dirs matter** → ClutTeX or `latexrun`
- **Package-heavy preamble, body iterating fast** → `mylatexformat` precompilation
- **Writing-phase, images irrelevant** → draft mode + `\pdfcompresslevel=0`
- **Multi-chapter book, chapters are independent** → `make -jN` parallel builds
- **CI cold start / GitHub Actions** → `setup-texlive-action` + cache + minimal scheme

## Parallelization rules

### Good fits for multi-agent analysis or parallel compile lanes

Use bounded lanes only when the boundary is explicit and one lane does not need to write another lane's aux state:

- `\include`-based chapters that can be compiled independently for measurement or preview
- `subfiles` / `standalone` repositories where subdocuments are already first-class compile units
- TikZ / PGFPlots externalization where each figure becomes a cacheable unit
- CI pipelines that intentionally shard chapter groups or subdocuments
- read-only analysis lanes such as timing/log analysis, structure audit, and cache-strategy review

### Bad fits for parallelization

Do not push parallel compile just because the repo is large. Reject or down-rank it when the bottleneck is mostly:

- package-heavy preamble loading
- bibliography, index, glossary, or cross-reference convergence
- a single monolithic document with shared aux churn
- a watch loop where orchestration overhead is larger than the saved compile time
- unclear output ownership for `build/`, `aux/`, cache directories, or generated figure files

### Single-writer rule

If multiple lanes are used, only one integrator should own the final recommendation and any shared continuity surface. Compile lanes should either:

- stay read-only, or
- write lane-local outputs only

Never let multiple lanes concurrently write the same aux tree unless the repo already has explicit isolation per chapter / figure / shard.

### Cache invalidation boundaries

Before trusting any speedup, verify invalidation after:

- **preamble change** → regenerate `.fmt` files and usually invalidate externalized figures that depend on changed macros/styles
- **bibliography change** → rerun bibtex/biber flow and confirm ref convergence on a full serial build
- **figure-source change** → rebuild only the affected externalized figure units, then confirm inclusion in the main document
- **chapter split change** → re-check `\includeonly`, subfile glue, and CI shard boundaries
- **CI environment change** → confirm cache keys invalidate when TeX packages / engine version / build recipe changes

### Watch loop vs CI priority

Treat local watch optimization and CI optimization as different problems:

- for **local watch loops**, prefer lower-latency tactics such as `latexmk -pvc`, draft mode, externalization, and preamble precompilation
- for **CI cold start**, prefer cacheability, reproducibility, and shard clarity such as Tectonic cache, minimal TeX Live installs, and explicit shard boundaries

If the user asks for both, optimize the dominant pain first instead of mixing local and CI tactics into one unreadable stack.

### Rust control-plane boundary

Rust is a good fit for durable lane orchestration, batch summaries, and host-native alias entrypoints. It is **not** the place to hard-code LaTeX bottleneck diagnosis itself. Keep tactic choice in the skill layer and use Rust only to coordinate how analysis/compile lanes run and resume.

## Stability and error recovery

### Interaction modes

Choose the mode that fits your workflow phase:

| Mode | Flag | Behavior | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `errorstopmode` | (default) | Stops on every error, waits for terminal input | Interactive debugging |
| `nonstopmode` | `-interaction=nonstopmode` | Continues past errors; writes all to `.log` | latexmk / CI builds |
| `batchmode` | `-interaction=batchmode` | Suppresses all terminal output except fatal errors | Fully automated scripts |
| `scrollmode` | `-interaction=scrollmode` | Scrolls past errors, shows output | Semi-interactive debugging |

### Error diagnosis workflow

1. **Search for `!`** in the `.log` file — every TeX error starts with `!`
2. **Use `-file-line-error`** to get `filename:line: error` format in the log
3. **Binary search**: comment out half the document, recompile, narrow down
4. **Minimal Working Example (MWE)**: isolate the broken snippet in a fresh file
5. **Clean aux files**: run `latexmk -C` to remove all generated files and rebuild from scratch

### Clean build discipline

Stale auxiliary files (`.aux`, `.toc`, `.lof`, `.bbl`) can cause phantom errors.
Adopt this discipline:

- Run `latexmk -C` (full clean) after major structural changes
- Run `latexmk -c` (light clean, keeps PDF) for routine resets
- In CI, always start from a clean state

## CI deep optimization

### GitHub Actions with TeX Live caching

```yaml
# .github/workflows/latex.yml
- uses: texlive-action/setup-texlive-action@v3
  with:
    # Minimal scheme — install only what you need
    profile-path: .github/texlive.profile
    packages-path: .github/texlive.packages
    # Caches TEXDIR automatically between runs
```

Example `.github/texlive.profile` for minimal footprint:

```
selected_scheme scheme-minimal
TEXDIR /tmp/texlive
TEXMFLOCAL /tmp/texlive/texmf-local
TEXMFSYSCONFIG /tmp/texlive/texmf-config
TEXMFSYSVAR /tmp/texlive/texmf-var
option_doc 0
option_src 0
```

### Docker optimization

- Use Alpine-based TeX Live images for smaller size
- Enable Docker layer caching: `docker buildx build --cache-from type=gha --cache-to type=gha,mode=max`
- Pre-install only required packages in the Dockerfile

### Reproducible PDF output

For bit-reproducible builds (useful for checksums, archival):

```latex
\pdfinfoomitdate=1
\pdftrailerid{}
\pdfsuppressptexinfo=-1
```

Set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` in CI to pin timestamps:

```bash
export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(date -d '2024-01-01' +%s)
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

### Dependency pinning

Use the `snapshot` package to record exact dependency versions:

```latex
\RequirePackage{snapshot}  % add before \documentclass
```

Generates a `.dep` file listing all package versions, which can be embedded via
`\RequireVersions{...}` for future verification.

## LuaLaTeX-specific notes

LuaLaTeX is typically 2–3× slower than pdfLaTeX due to OpenType font processing
and Lua interpreter overhead. If using LuaLaTeX:

- Minimize loaded fonts and font features
- Consider `babel` over `polyglossia` (measurable speedup in some locales)
- Evaluate whether `microtype` is worth the overhead
- TikZ externalization is even more impactful under LuaLaTeX

## Validation checklist

After any speed change:

1. time a **clean build**
2. time a **warm build**
3. time the **edit → preview** loop
4. verify references / bibliography still converge
5. verify cache invalidation after:
   - preamble change
   - bibliography change
   - figure-source change
6. verify **error recovery**: compile a deliberately broken file and confirm sensible error output
7. verify **clean build reproducibility**: `latexmk -C && latexmk` produces identical output
8. for CI: verify **cache hit** on second run and **cold-start** timing
