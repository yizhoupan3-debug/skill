# Claude Agents Directory

These project-scoped Claude Code subagents help Claude use this repository's
shared routing, execution, and host-projection system without duplicating it.
The policy source of truth is still `../../AGENT.md`.

Available agents:

- `framework-router.md`: read-only router for choosing the right repo skill,
  gate, and next files to inspect
- `skill-maintainer.md`: bounded editor for `skills/**` and nearby framework
  surfaces when the task already has a clear write scope
- `state-artifact-keeper.md`: bounded maintainer for `.supervisor_state.json`
  and the shared task-artifact contract
- `claude-host-maintainer.md`: bounded maintainer for `.claude/**`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, and `.mcp.json` without forking shared policy

Design rules for these subagents:

- They must read `../../AGENT.md` first and treat it as authoritative.
- They should stay thin: route into existing repo skills and artifacts instead
  of restating the framework.
- They should keep outputs concise and integration-friendly for the parent
  agent.
- They should not widen scope beyond the surfaces named in their prompt.
